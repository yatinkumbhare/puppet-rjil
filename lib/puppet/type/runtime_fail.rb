Puppet::Type.newtype(:runtime_fail) do

  desc <<-'EOD'
  Fail the puppet execution on runtime. The problem with fail function is that
, as funtions are evaluated on comple time, the execution will fail during that
time, so if the condition evaluates a resource which create on the same
role/node will cause the execution always fail as the puppet execution willl
never happen.
