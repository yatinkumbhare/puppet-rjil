# rustedhalo_apt_repo_release override make sure people have option to choose
# which repository to use.  Valid repos
# trusty-unstable - raw packages, with unit testing and may be gate testing.
#                   This is the place the package arived initially.
# trusty-testing  - This is the repo used for acceptance testing, this is same as
#                   trusty-unstable, but pipeline-at-prepare job takes snapshot
#                   of trusty-unstable and sync to this repo. So it may take few
#                   minutes to land the package here.
# trusty          - This is the place the stable packages will live. All
#                   packages that passed the acceptance testing will arrive
#                   here. This is the same repo staging and production will be
#                   using. It will take some time (typically 3-4 hours at this
#                   moment) from when the package got created to reach here.
